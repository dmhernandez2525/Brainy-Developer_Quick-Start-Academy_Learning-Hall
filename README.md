## Technologies & Challenges

### Architecture
The overall application architecture is geared toward rapid development and maintainability of an application that is deployed on both web and mobile.

To that end, **Save A Stray** is built with the **MERN** stack (**MongoDB, Express, React, and Node**).

Additionally, **Redux** is used for front-end devlopment with **React**, bundling of **client-side javascript** is accomplished by **Webpack**, and **Babel** is used to transpile **ES6+ Javascript** for backward browser compatibility.

Finally, the app will be deployed to **Heroku** .

### Backend: Rails, Ruby
The backend will be entirely platform agnostic with the exception of potential performance optimizations per platform. The separation of the back and front allows for either to be modified, built, updated, or swapped out entirely with minimal impact to the other.

### Frontend: React
 React Redux
